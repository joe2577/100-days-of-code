# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 10, 2017  Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my survey form.  Figured out how to use textarea to create a bigger input field than just one line.  Been looking for this for awhile!

**Thoughts** I am starting and stopping.  Stopping when I feel like I can't do this.  Hopefully this 100 day challenge will force my hand.

### Day 2: August 11, 2017  Friday

**Today's progress**: I continued on the survey form.  Figured out difference between radio & checkboxes.  Made my first dropdown box!

**Thoughts** Once I got started it got easier.  Still a lot of google-ing to figure out how to write the code.  With time I guess.
